I'm an electronic music artist looking to build a portofolio website to showcase my work.

I've previously built websites/webapps/front-ends using python, node, ts and js. 
These were deployed using supabase, vercel and resend.

I'd like this website to be close to state of the art and willing to explore a new wstack to achieve that.
Specifically, I want the experience to be interactive (for example including 3D virtual 'gallery' space that visitors can walk around in and explore the art on display, or simply innovative music visualizers etc...) 

Please help me create an concrete, detailed and actionable action plan to build this using agentic tools.
